# Day 1 – Beginner Excel Practice

Hi! I'm Ummuani, an aspiring data analyst taking my first official step into this journey.

Today I practiced some key Excel skills.
- Used **SUM** formulas to calculate total expenses by product and by day
- Practiced **relative and absolute referencing**
- Used **COUNTIF** to count how many times "Sweets" appeared in the product list
- Created a **Clustered Column Chart** to visualize total expenses by category
- Practiced formatting with **Merge & Center**, bold headers, and cleaned up for print view

This is part of my daily challenge to learn, document, and show up consistently — even when it’s not perfect.

I’ll be updating this repo daily as I grow from Excel to SQL, Power BI, Tableau, Python — and eventually build a solid portfolio to land my first data job!

Let’s see where consistency gets me.
